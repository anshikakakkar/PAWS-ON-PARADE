       The PAWS ON PARADE shelter is home to many abandoned pets who have been discarded by their owners for <br /> 
       various reasons. Moreover desi puppies from the streets also make their way to us. So do kittens and cats. <br /> 
       <span className='text-slate-500'>While the adoption team leaves no 
       stone un-turned in striving to find homes for these babies, <br /> ADOPTION from shelter is still very low.</span> <br /> <br />


Adoptions are also made difficult by the fact that almost all abandoned pets come to us without any <br /> 
history either medical or behavioral. Some are dropped outside the shelter to the mercy of fate, some are <br />
 brought in as patients to the clinic and left behind while everyone’s back is turned, some are dropped from <br />
  moving cars and some are left on busy Delhi roads far from their homes so that they are not able to make <br />their way back to 
their families and homes and are found & brought in by good Samaritans. <br /><br />

The shelter also rescues or receives many desi pups as orphaned, lost or sick/injured cases. Kittens are <br />
also left for the same reasons.
<br /> <br />

We firmly believe all these dogs belong in a home with a loving family.

       Adoption Process
       </h1>

       <div className='text-lg text-slate-400 font-medium leading-loose'>
       The adoption team interacts, observes and understands the dogs at the shelter before they are put up for <br /> adoption. 
       If a dog falls sick while under our care, we try and find foster homes for them to recover (or <br /> forever homes 
       if they’re willing to take on and look after the dog). If we feel a dog needs special behavior <br /> 
       correction, we put the dog under care of dog behaviorist before adoption. We also try and find the right <br /> 
       matches among the pets and the prospective homes. <br /> <br />
     

       Interested families are put through a house check/house visit, the main purpose for which is an address <br />
       verification as well as an interactive session with the whole family to asses whether they are ready for a <br />
        pet and to orient them if required. We firmly believe a pet should be a family commitment as the whole <br />
        family’s support is necessary for the welfare of the pet. <br /><br />

        Once an adoption goes through, the adoption team stays in touch with the family to counsel them and <br />
        assists with any hiccups for a smooth transition and a successful adoption. House checks/house visits <br />
         post adoption to ensure that the pet is well looked after is also part of the adoption process. <br /><br />

        Why Adoption ?
       </h1>

       <div className='text-lg text-slate-400 font-medium leading-loose'>

       The adoption program is a huge and essential part of the functioning of Friendicoes. The shelter takes in 8 <br /> 
       dogs/pups/kittens per day on an average. Some of them go back to their territories post medical care but <br />
       some of them stay back for many reasons. That means the shelter space is occupied by these permanent <br />
       residents. <span className='text-slate-500'>We can only continue to take in more animals when some if not all of these 
       animals find <br />
       homes leaving behind space for new entries. </span><br /><br />
        
        <div className='flex flex-col items-center'>

family’s support is necessary for the welfare of the pet. <br /><br />


Also adopting pets from shelters not only saves a life but also helps in bringing down the puppy mills and <br />
breeders business. Most breeders use dogs as machines to produce pups, which they sell for profit. The <br />
 females are forcibly bred one litter after another and they are kept in deplorable conditions; the females <br />
 are then thrown out once they’re unable to produce pups. PAWS ON PARADE receives a lot of breeder’s rejects in <br /> 
 inhumane condition. Some come in the form of a bag of bones while others are “chronically depressed” <br />
 after being separated from their pups too early or are suffering severe medical conditions due to being <br />
 over bred.
