            We cannot emphasize enough how important <br />
            fostering is. It can make a difference of life and death since
            shelters can be high risk zones of infections. It <br />
            can also save two lives at once. One of the dog/pup/kitten you have
            taken under your care, and second of <br />
            the animal that we are able to accept at the shelter because of the
            space created. The minimum foster <br />
            period we require is two weeks. The longer the better because moving
            an animal from home to home can <br />
            be disorientating and confusing for the animal. We would like to
            point out here that fostering needs a <br />
            string heart. You need to be able to stay a little detached from the
            animal you take under your wing else <br />
            there can be a lot of heart break lying ahead for you. But it is all
            worth it at the end –{" "}

            This includes walking dogs, cleaning the cages, <br />
            playing with the puppies & kittens and helping out in various other
            ways at the shelter. We always need <br />
            help WALKING THE SHELTER DOGS in the evenings. We have over 100 dogs
            at any given time, apart from <br />
            others animals and we would love if each one of them can go for a
            nice, long walk at least once a day. <br />
            Most of these dogs have to be kept tied or confined to cages due to
            space constraint as well as for health <br />
            reasons so a walk and some fresh air. If you can volunteer your time
            every evening, the dogs and the staff <br />
            will be very thankful to you! <br />

            on the adopted dogs/pups with post-adoption house checks. We also
